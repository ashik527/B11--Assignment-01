                <p class="section-description">“It's not language that sits easily with 84-year-old Muhammad Yunus, though the Nobel laureate says he can forgive the students salty exuberance. “The words are very explosive,” Yunus tells TIME with a chuckle. “These young minds are full of ideas and ambitions and aspirations. They depicted their future in those murals and it's something much greater than Bangladesh has ever seen.”The previous government created this environment of total oppression, denial of everything, killing at random, disappearance of people, destroying every single institution,” he says. “It was a fascist regime.Not only is she being hosted by India, the worst part is that she's talking, which causes a lot of problems for us,” says Yunus. “It makes people very unhappy to hear that voice. So this is something that we have to resolve.They formed six reform commissions without discussion with any of the political parties,” says A K M Wahiduzzaman, information and technology affairs secretary of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). “This is not a good sign. This is a sign of an autocratic government.”
